            <h1>How to Cook Wagyu</h1>
            <p>Cooking wagyu for the first time can be scary as it's such an expensive and high-quality cut of meat. Most people aren't exactly used to preparing it. We've prepared some recipes for you to try with our products to make yourself a nice meal. Here are the recipes.</p>

                <h2>Recipe 1: Basic Steak</h2>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SdHE2zgSaxU" title="Basic Steak Recipe" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>Here we have a basic steak recipe. Applying this recipe to a wagyu cut of steak will allow you to make a very basic but incredibly tasty steak. The wagyu steak, in the end, is still just a steak, so cooking it like any other steak to your preference results in an incredibly well-made dish.</p>

                <h2>Recipe 2: Wagyu Sandwich</h2>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7zuefUfxPf0" title="Wagyu Sandwich Recipe" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>This recipe is for what's called a wagyu katsu sandwich. It takes a wagyu steak and cooks it to perfection, making it into a small sandwich with a katsu sauce. While this is a simple dish to make, the quality of the meat makes the flavor of the sandwich so rich and the meat melts right in your mouth from its tenderness. With our wagyu, the meat is tender enough for the steak to be cooked whole as shown in the video.</p>
