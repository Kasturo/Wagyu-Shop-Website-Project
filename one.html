                <p class="content">As this is a relatively new business, our product display is very limited. Our goal is to bring more products available to our customers by the end of the year or sooner. We aim to make more affordable processed wagyu available similar to the burger patties. We also aim to have a wider selection of cuts made available. We also plan to make available dinner sets which will be made of special cuts perfect for making easy steaks.</p>
