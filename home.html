        <h2>Discover the Finest Halal Wagyu</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our Halal Wagyu website! We are dedicated to providing you with the highest quality Halal-certified Wagyu beef. Learn more about our products, cooking tips, and the story behind our brand.</p>
        <p>We strive to provide higher quality beef across Canada whilst also raising our cattle with a higher standard of living as opposed to normal grass-fed cows.</p>
        <p>We ensure that our Wagyu cows are raised in great conditions with plenty of exercise and high quality feed. This ensures high quality meat from each cow.</p>
        <p>We are also HMA halal certified and ensure that all of our meat is hand-slaughtered halal and that everything involving the cows life is in line with the Islamic protocol.</p>
        <p>In Canada it is hard for people to get their hands on halal wagyu, this limits the number of Muslims who would be able to try it. Our goal is to make it available to Muslims in Canada at a reasonable price as well.</p>

    <li>Halal meat tends to be healthier:</li>
    <p class="content">
        Halal meat involves draining blood from the animal and involves killing the animal in as painless and humane way as possible to avoid any stress in the animal. The meat being halal also means it'll be free from any chemicals, preservatives or any other type of harmful additives which can be found in other meats which also in turn makes it healthier.</p>
    <li>Wagyu beef is of higher quality in comparison to normal beef:</li>
    <p class="content">
        Wagyu cows are raised in higher quality living condition as opposed to normal cattle. Unlike normal cattle they are also given a healthy amount of exercise each day and given more than enough space for them to grow better and enjoy a higher quality of life. The higher quality of life of a wagyu cow not only results in a better taste, but also has mention of being healthier in comparison to normal cows. Wagyu cows have controlled level of fats and also low level of cholesterol which result in it being healther. More information on health benefits of wagyu can be found <a href="https://wagyushop.com/blogs/news/health-benefits-of-wagyu-beef" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
    <li>Our process is more ethical:</li>
    <p class="content"> 
        As opposed to the process of most cattle farming, we aim to be more ethical in order to allow the wagyu to develop to the highest quality and to ensure that it is also in alignment with the Islamic code. As per the wagyu process the cows are given more living space then needed to allow them to move around as much as they please and get the exercise they need to remain healthty. Even our slaugtering process for the cows is more ethical as it involves making it as painless for the animal as possible which allows the animals to be free from as much stress as possible.</p>
